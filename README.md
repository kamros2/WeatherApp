# Weather Application
Made in React library weather application uses data provided by [GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)

# Run it locally
1. Install Node.js
2. In the directory of the project run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`. It will open the app automatically

Write a city name in a search bar and check the weather for the next 5 days. Due to the technical reasons with the free and therefore limted GeoDB API the database is limited to cities above 1 000 000 inhabitants.
